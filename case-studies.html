            <button class="collapsible">Project 1: Ear-Based Attendance Monitoring System and Databasing</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Title:</strong> Ear-Based Attendance Monitoring System</p>
                <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)</p>
                <p><strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong> MATLAB, Image Processing, Database Management</p>

                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>The Ear-Based Attendance Monitoring System leverages the unique structural features of the human ear for biometric identification and attendance monitoring. This innovative project was developed during my undergraduate studies in the ECE department. The system captures and stores images of users' ears in a database and then identifies individuals by comparing real-time ear scans with the stored images. This method provides a contactless and reliable solution for attendance tracking in educational institutions and other organizations.</p>

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>Traditional attendance systems, such as manual roll calls or swipe cards, are prone to errors and can be easily manipulated. Biometric systems, while more secure, often rely on fingerprints or facial recognition, which have their limitations in terms of hygiene and accuracy, respectively. The unique and relatively invariant structure of the human ear presents a novel biometric feature that can be used for accurate and non-intrusive user identification.</p>

                <h3>System Components</h3>

                            <li>A structured database schema ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>During attendance, the system captures a new image of the user's ear.</li>
                            <li>The new image is preprocessed and its features are extracted in real-time.</li>
                            <li>Feature matching algorithms compare the real-time features with the stored database to identify the user.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Attendance Logging:</strong>

                            <li>Upon successful identification, the user's attendance is automatically logged into the system.</li>
                            <li>The system generates attendance reports and analytics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
